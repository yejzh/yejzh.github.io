My research lies in the intersection between philosophy and human sciences e.g. economics, political science, psychology, etc., seeking to uncover the underlying values and normative frameworks that enable as well as structures our personal, social and political lives. I also explore how intelligence, both natural and artificial, works, and the structuring implications it has for the practical side of our lives, both now and future.

In methodology, I employ philosophical devices like conceptual analysis, conceptual engineering, as well as what Floridi calls conceptual design. At the same time, I also borrow devices and results from empirical sciences and formal sciences, using them as scaffolds of thought, hence no strict disciplinary boundaries.

My research lies in the intersection between philosophy and more formalized human sciences, seeking to uncover the underlying value and normative structure that enables and constraints our personal, social and public life. Currently, the focus is on the public reason project. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress.

I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. 

I also offer a research statement  that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas.

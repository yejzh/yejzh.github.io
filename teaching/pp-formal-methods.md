title: Formal Models in Practical Philosophy 
permalink: /teaching/pp-formal-methods/
---

There are quite some formal models employed by practical philosophers, which make their arguments clearer and stronger. The social contract, for exmaple, is the most well-known model among them. In order for students to better understand the writings of other theorists, as well as to build better arguments for themselves, it is worth examining and learning to use several major models that are widely used in practical philosophy. This course serves such an aim.

I borrow [Hun Chung](https://sites.google.com/site/hunchung1980/home)'s idea in stressing the importance of formal methods, not only in political philosophy, but in philosophy in general, as far as it applies properly to the topic in question. I summarize Chung's idea into a rough mindmap, hoping to provide some intuitive clue for the beginner.

permalink: /teaching/pp/
---

Political Philosophy  is the combination of politics and philosophy, i.e. using philosophical approaches to analyze political entities, relationships and ultimately draw normative conclusions on how collective should be lived. As an introductory class, we will cover basic some methods used in political philosophical analysis, and then examine several core concepts that are crucial for political life. No previous background in political philosophy is required, but students are expected to be familiar with *analytic* style of philosophical thinking. During the course, they need to do conceptual analysis, argument evaluation and argument construction. The course will end with a term paper as final evaluation, but before actually writing this paper, students are required (mid-term) to submit a paper proposal. Only when the teacher approves the paper proposal should they proceed into the actual writing.

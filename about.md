I am primarily a person of the academe, most of the time reading, writing, teaching. But I do have interests outside of the academe, although not many.

Productivity setups are also interesting me, in the hope that my work environment can be more inviting, Jensen's [write no matter what](https://www.amazon.com/Write-Matter-What-Academics-Publishing/dp/022646170X){:target="_blank"}" has a lot of good advice.

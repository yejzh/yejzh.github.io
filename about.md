I am primarily a person of the academy, reading, writing, teaching. But I do have interests outside of the academy, although not many. 

I am into sports like table tennis and badminton and had spent quite some time on both. Productivity setups are also interesting for me, in the hope of making workspace more efficient as well as better looking. Currently I am learning how to take inter-linked notes via the mighty legendary editor [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs), with the newly developed package called [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam) based on [org-mode](https://orgmode.org).

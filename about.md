I am primarily a person of the academe, most of the time reading, writing, teaching. But I do have interests outside of the academy, although not many. 


I am into sports like table tennis and badminton and had spent quite some time on both. Productivity setups are also interesting for me, in the hope that it can make my workspace more efficient as well as better looking.

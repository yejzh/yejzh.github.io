<h1>Welcome</h1>

	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and courses I teach. I am Associate Professor in <a href="http://phil.hust.edu.cn/english/Home.htm" target="_blank">School of Philosophy</a> at <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science &amp; Technology</a>. 
	</p>I work mainly in moral and political philosophy, focusing on the public reason project. I see the integration of normative and empirical inquiries necessary for making sense of and defending meaningful normative schemes that shape and oversee human interaction. 
<p>Besides, I also explore into the inner structure and workings of intelligence, both natural and artificial, to reflect on basic presumpstions and methodologies we employ when philosophizing, as well as to make sense and deal with practical implicatons brought about by AI.</p>

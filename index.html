<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and courses I teach. I am Associate Professor in School of Philosophy at Huazhong University of Science & Technology. My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection between philosophy and positive human sciences including economics, political science and psychology. My current research explores how a legitimate and stable social order can be established and sustained by Public Reason.</p>

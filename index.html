<h1>Welcome</h1>

	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and courses I teach. I am Associate Professor in <a href="http://phil.hust.edu.cn/english/Home.htm" target="_blank">School of Philosophy</a> at <a href="http://english.hust.edu.cn" target="_blank">Huazhong University of Science &amp; Technology</a>. 
	</p>I work mainly in moral and political philosophy, focusing on the public reason project. I see the integration of normative and empirical inquiries necessary for making sense of and defending meaningful normative schemes that shape and oversee human interaction. Besides, I also work in applied ethics, focusing mainly on AI related issues, since rapid development in AI brings deep challenges to basic presumptions in human life, as well as to the methodology we philosophize about them.</p>

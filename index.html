<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
<p>
This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research and courses I teach. I am Associate Professor in <a target="_blank" href="http://phil.hust.edu.cn/english/Home.htm">School of Philosophy</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://english.hust.edu.cn">Huazhong University of Science &amp; Technology</a>.

My research and teaching interests focus on the broad intersection between philosophy and positive human sciences including economics, political science and psychology. My current research explores how a legitimate and stable social order can be established and sustained by&nbsp;<strong>Public Reason</strong>.

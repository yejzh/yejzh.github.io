excerpt: "to expand too widely is to stretch oneself too thin"

No one can do all things, even the most talented genius can cover only a small range of what is there for exploration, although relatively wider than others. To be wise, to use the original name of philosophy, is to do the most essential things and put all other things aside.

The adminitrative move from the teaching & research unit of western philosophy to that of ethics marks a timely reorientation in my academic work. I can now focus on what I am really interested in, namely practical philosophy, including most importantly political philosophy, moral psychology, and social ontology. As teaching requires, I may also touch a bit of meta-ethics. And this is already a wide field, wider than I can effectively cover.

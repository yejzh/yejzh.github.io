I do not anticipate doing a lot of professional blogging here. Before too long, I intend to start more “substantive” semi-regular blogging at another blog that is a consortium of scholars all of whom possess an eclectic approach to understanding problems of contempoary political philosophy, especially about justice and public reason. 

This blog on my academic website will be more about professional development for students at [Huazhong University of Science & Technology][1]. I care about the development of students at the undergraduate level and will use this blog as a written summary of professional development talks I intend to give. Each talk will correspond with a written post on this blog and, when appropriate, a PDF presentation.

Contributions may come from other faculty members in our department at HUST and I welcome any input readers or colleagues/friends at other institutions may have.

excerpt: "This site will post my reflections on political philosophy, moral philosophy and philosophical education in general."
---


This site will mainly posts my reflections on political philosophy, moral philosophy and philosophical methodology in general. It will also cover professional development stuff, especially for my students at [Huazhong University of Science & Technology](http://english.hust.edu.cn){:target="_blank"}. I care about the development of students especially at the undergraduate level and will use this site as a written summary of professional development talks I intend to give. Each talk will correspond with a written post on this site and, when appropriate, a PDF presentation.

Contributions may also come from other faculty members from our school of philosophy at HUST andÂ I welcome any input readers or colleagues/friends at other institutions may have.
